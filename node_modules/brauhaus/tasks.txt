Use object getters/setters for computed values

Currently values like `fermentable.weightLb()` require a function call while `fermentable.weight` is a property. There are dozens of examples like this in Brauhaus, and it may make sense to migrate to using Javascript's object getter/setter mechanism to make computed values like the above properties: `fermentable.weightLb`. It also allows us to define read-only properties.

This feature is supported on all browsers and runtimes that are currently supported for Brauhaus.

Seems to break older browsers though... maybe not a great idea? Knockout doesn't use it, nor does jQuery.
